# WWG Analysis Signal Smaples production

WWG Signal Samples follow the samples chain in CMS with NANOAODv9

LHEGEN >> SIM >> DIGI >> HLT >> RECO >> MINIAODv2 >> NANOAODv9

WWG gridpack has been generated by MadGraph@NLO with genproduction master branch (https://github.com/cms-sw/genproductions)

Hgamma processes used the JHUGen to decay Higgs

aQGC processes are under preparation 

--------------
## WWG Signal Production

after preparing the fragments in every step, NANOAOD samples can be generated below:

for example:

```bash
voms-proxy-init -voms cms -valid 192:00
cd 2018
mkdir log
submit_condor submit_wwgamma_signal18_NLO.jdl
```

one submit can generate 600,000 events for a year.

--------------
## Hgamma Samples Production

one Hgamma process has 4 kinds of samples: uu~/dd~/ss~/cc~
every submit can generate 500,000 events for a year.

for examples:
```bash
cd Hgamma
voms-proxy-init -voms cms -valid 192:00
cd 2018
mkdir log
submit_condor submit_signal.jdl
```
--------------

haddnano.py can be used to combine all events into one R00T file
